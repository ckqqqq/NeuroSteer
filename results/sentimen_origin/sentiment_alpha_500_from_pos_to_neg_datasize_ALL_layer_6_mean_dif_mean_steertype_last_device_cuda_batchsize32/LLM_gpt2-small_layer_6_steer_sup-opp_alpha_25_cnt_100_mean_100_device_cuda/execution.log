The Supreme Court has ruled that the right to life is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment and that it is not. So, what does this mean for women who want to have an abortion? Well, if you're going to have an abortion, you need a doctor's appointment and your doctor will be there for you. If they don't have one or two appointments then they can go ahead and terminate your pregnancy without having to pay any fees or anything like that.

The other thing that's interesting is that the Supreme Court has ruled in Roe v. Wade that it's unconstitutional to have an abortion in a state where there is no statute of limitations on the procedure, and so it's not illegal to have an abortion in a state where there are no laws of limitations on the procedure. So I think we're going to see some sort of constitutional amendment or something like that, but I don't know if it will happen anytime soon

So what does this mean for you? Well, if you're pregnant and want to have an abortion, then you should get your insurance or pay your premiums up
