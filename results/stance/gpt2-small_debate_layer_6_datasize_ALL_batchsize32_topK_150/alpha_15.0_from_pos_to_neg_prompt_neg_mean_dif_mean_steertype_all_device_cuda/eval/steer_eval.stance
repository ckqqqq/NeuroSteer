It starts by correctly identifying Albert Einstein as a famous American physicist, but then it misrepresents his beliefs and theories. The part about the universe being a \"giant chess piece that can be broken by a single move\" is not aligned with any known statements or theories by Einstein. Furthermore, the sentence repeats \"theory of relativity\" without providing the actual content of the theory, which makes it appear more like a nonsensical statement rather than an expression of support for Einstein's work. Therefore, since the sentence does not accurately reflect Einstein's theories and appears to present them in a distorted way, it could be seen as opposing or at least not supporting a proper understanding of his contributions. However, if the intent was to positively highlight Einstein, the wording and factual errors lead to an 'oppose' stance due to the misinformation."}]}
